[Game Instructions](https://github.com/IdesOfJune/Fracture/blob/master/instructions.md)

## Sudo Code for Game Implementation ##

```C
/*  Fracture (Game)
 *  
 *  Setup: For 3-6 players. Each player gets 5-6 tiles of a specific color.
 *         Game starts will all tiles connected, but completely segregated by color.
 *
 *  Goal: Get your tiles to be touching only other players tiles.
 *        Your tiles must be touching at least two other tiles to feel happily diverse.
 *
 *  Turns: Start from a player of choice and then go clockwise taking turns.
 *         A turn consists of fracturing the population into two sub populations,
 *         and then connecting them back together in any way you please.
 *  
 *  When a player has a tile fully diversified, it will blink in unison with other blinking Blinks of its color,
 *  first player to have all of their tiles blink wins.

	// team variables/colors: red, yellow, blue, green, orange, magenta
	// variables for flashing: urge, period, duration

// Loop
	// if button is triple clicked
		// change team to next color team in list

	// if more than 1 neighbor present and none of the neighbors share my color
		// set flag to flash in happy state

	// handle synchronous color flashing

	// update general urge (i.e. urge++)

	// if neighbor flashes (i.e. state reflects a flash)
		// broadcast the flash on IR (maybe only broadcast if not your color)
		// if neighbor is my color
			// update urge accordingly (+= urge/10)

	// if urge greater than threshold
		// broadcast the flash message

	// display solid or flashing
	// if flag for happy state satisfied
		// display flash when urge to flash
	// else
		// display solid color
